#### Git vs. GitHub
##### Git is a **version control system** meaning it tracks changes. In it you have different filles and ines of code all used to add information for each file. When you create a file you use touch to make a README.md,c9 to open the README.md,and then add it to the repository by ussing git add. You can initialize it then push your code to the staging area Github uses Git to be able to have an online database. It shows all the text put into README.m. it is the place where you can look at other peoples work and fork,clone, or just look it over. It is a place for different people to collaborate.
